        <h3>Video Files</h3>
<!--            ADD LINK FOR DATABRARY-->
            <p>The video files for this dataset can be found on Databrary. After navigating to this website,
                the recorded sessions can be viewed. They can be sorted by participant information, the
                condition of the data recording, the task performed during the recording, or the context of
                the setting. Once you have navigated to the session you would like to view, either click on the
                download for the zip file, or copy the link to that address. If you are downloading the zip file,
                after unzipping you should see four files, three videos (.mp4) and one comma-separated values
                file (.csv). All four of these files should be uploaded. If using the download via link feature,
                just paste the link into the text box and click download.</p>

        <h3>Data Files</h3>
<!--        ADD LINK FOR OSF-->
            <p>After uploading the video files, navigate to the Open Source Framework (OSF) website, where
                the data files that correspond to the video files are located. To find the correct files, look
                for the folder with the same name as the files downloaded from Databrary. Once you have located
                these files, either download the zip file, or copy the link to the zip download. Ignore the
                DS_Store file and the processedGaze folder (if applicable), and upload all the other files. Once
                both of these upload tasks have been done, you will be able to proceed to the viewer. </p>
