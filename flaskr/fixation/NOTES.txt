validation_orig_times = when nt normalised to zero
when there are four values in the .ymal for validation_X, then use the last two values
the last validation frame is with respect to the world sampling frequency (30Hz)

orig_times may be in reference to zero
using frames will throw off the data due to sampling frequency mismatch
using validation times is better

62.5Hz is gyro sampling sample_rate_hz
200hz is odometry sample rate

Brian guesses that Python is doing 20 * 10^2 (put into scientific notation without telling us), which is hte mismatch between the graphing axes and the 

attempt list comprehension
or change x-axis display values for the x axis
